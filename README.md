# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

##### 1. Original Files & Directories provided by Coursera:
* README.txt
* activity_labels.txt
* features.txt
* features_info.txt
* __test__
      * subject_test.txt
      * X_test.txt
      * y_test.txt
      * __Inertial_Signals__ //(Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer and Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope for the test set)
* __train__
      * subject_train.txt
      * X_train.txt
      * y_train.txt
      * __Inertial_Signals__ //(Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer and Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope for the train set)
     
##### 2. Script that turns the raw data into a tidy dataset: __run_analysis.R__
     *How to use the script:*
          -clone the repo in your local PC
          -import the script into R: -->  source("run_analysis.R")
          -open a text file named "final_ds_with_average_measures.txt" with the tidy dataset that was created in the same folder where the script is located. Note that another file with the same tidy dataset but in .csv format will also be created. Both can be used.

##### 3. CodeBook.md contains the description of the tidy dataset

##### 4. "final_ds_with_average_measures.txt" and "final_ds_with_average_measures.csv" are the plain text and csv format versions of the tidy dataset
